This page is for mods i've created that are for JS Engine but can also work with other psych engine versions??

To download the charts, you have to download all of them at once because of how frequently updated they are!

1. Press the green button labeled "Code"
2. Press "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip the files
4. Drag and drop them into your JS Engine's mods folder!

If you want to use any of these charts, you have permission to HOWEVER you MUST give me credit.

PS: This is over 5GB worth of content.

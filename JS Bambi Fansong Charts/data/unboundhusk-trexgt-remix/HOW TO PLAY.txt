To play, download it from this link: https://mega.nz/file/XS5jBQ7Y#g2qYXHVYU8SLHw8zWJ80K9_gJiXINxaF6a9F8iSZmlk

Inside it are three jsons, each ending with a different letter:
"a" is the first chart. It includes sections 0 to 331.
"b" is the second chart. It includes sections 332 to 345.
"c" is the last chart. It includes the last part of the chart.

There is also a merged version, which can be downloaded here: https://mega.nz/file/XWIGGJzR#mB3B5OGqhZlFo3SZQbuz2SFvhDlL9zA03lNcQdKNAyU

Inside the ncScripts folder are also 2 lua scripts for difficulties "b" and "C". Use that script depending on what chart you're loading.

To play each chart, remove the ending letter suffix from each json.
For example, "unboundhusk-trexgt-remix-a" would be "unboundhusk-trexgt-remix".

This will allow the game to read the chart.
